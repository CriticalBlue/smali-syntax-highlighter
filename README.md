Dalvik bytecode / Smali syntax highlighting for gedit and other tools that use GtkSourceView.

This is a language spec for GtkSourceView. Based on the Android Dalvik Bytecode specification, with a few extra bits added from the smali syntax (https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali).

Usage: Place smali.lang into either of:

* /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/ (system-level)
* ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/ (user-level)

Restart, open up your .smali's and enjoy all the glorious readability :)
